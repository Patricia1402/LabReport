Ques3 Cramer’s rule is used to solve the linear equations. ax+by=e, cx+dy=f; x = (ed-bf)/(ad-bc) y=(af-ec)/(ad-bc)

Write a program that ask the user to enter two input line in the format of ax+by=e and cx+dy=f. Display the result of x and y. If ad – bc is equal to 0. Display "The equation has no solution". Given the value of a, b, c, d is (1-9).

Problem Description

How to prompt user to input 2 lines of linear equations in the form of "ax + by = e"?
Solution : Print instruction to user to input 2 lines of linear equation in the form of "ax + by = e" using syntax System.out.print(parameter)
How to solve simultaneous equation from line 1 and line 2?
Solution : Use if statement and arithmetic operators, *,- and /, to solve simultaneous equation based on formula and value of input.
How to handle case if ad - bc = 0?
Solution : Print message that indicates there is no solution found using syntax System.out.print(parameter)
How to strip value from input string?
Solution : Use the split method public String[ ] split(String regex) to strip value from input string.
How to convert String to integer?
Solution : Use Integer. parseInt(arrLinen[n]) method to convert String to integer
What if input is x+y=a?
Solution : Coding will not run because form is not followed
How to display answer x and y?
Solution : Print answer using syntax System.out.print(parameter) and + to call value x and y
